# City School Analysis

## Overview of this Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to omit certain grades from Thomas High School and test if there was any academic dishonesty in the grading process for the ninth grade class leading to skewed scores. As well as to repeat the initial analysis in its entirety to see how the results are effected.

## Results

- The District Summary was affected due to the fact that 461 9th graders from Thomas High School had to be ommited from the data in order to test this hypothesis. The overall scores and percentages of passing students decreased as seen in the results below.

- The School Summary analysis was affected greatly in this case. The percentages of passing Math and Reading rose significantly after the removal of 9th grade scores, up from 66.9% and 69.7% respectively, to 93.1% and 97.2%. Even with this massive jump in passing percentage, the overall % was not changed widely. This lead to the overall passing % to jump from 65% to 90%, therefore bringing Thomas High School from a mid performing school to one of the top 5 performers.
