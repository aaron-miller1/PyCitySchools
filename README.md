# City School Analysis

## Overview of this Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to omit certain grades from Thomas High School and test if there was any academic dishonesty in the grading process for the ninth grade class leading to skewed scores. As well as to repeat the initial analysis in its entirety to see how the results are effected.

## Results

- The District Summary was affected due to the fact that 461 9th graders from Thomas High School had to be ommited from the data in order to test this hypothesis. The overall scores and percentages of passing students decreased as seen in the results blow.
